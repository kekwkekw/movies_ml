Hello! The goals of these programs are:
1) imdb_parse.py - to web-scrap imdb, creating movies_data.csv database (includes around 5000 movies from 1995 to our days)
2) create_film.py - to fill the information about movie(-s) you are interested in: either fictional or those that have not been released yet. Info is saved to the dream_movies.csv
3) preprocessing_and_predicting.ipynb - name speaks for itself, isn't it? Outputs mean and mae of grosses, to judge model's accuracy, and predicted grosses for the movies, created by you
